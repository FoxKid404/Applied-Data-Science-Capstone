# Applied Data Science Capstone Labs
This repository contains my completed laboratory assignments and projects for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course. The labs cover a range of essential topics in data science, from data collection and wrangling to exploratory analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboard development.

# Repository Structure
The labs are organized into individual folders, each corresponding to a specific topic or assignment. This structure is designed to make it easy to navigate and find specific lab materials.

Here's a breakdown of the folder structure:

Exploratory Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib/: Focuses on in-depth data exploration and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
Exploratory Analysis Using SQL/: Explores data analysis techniques using SQL queries, demonstrating data retrieval and manipulation.
Hands on Lab Complete the Machine Learning Prediction lab/: Contains work related to building and evaluating machine learning models for prediction tasks.
Hands-on Lab Build an Interactive Dashboard with Ploty Dash/: Showcases the development of interactive web dashboards using Plotly and Dash for data visualization.
Hands-on Lab Complete the Data Collection API Lab/: Covers methods for collecting data using various APIs.
Hands-on Lab Complete the Data Collection with Web Scraping lab/: Demonstrates techniques for extracting data from websites using web scraping.
Hands-on Lab Data Wrangling/: Addresses the critical process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.
Hands-on Lab Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium lab/: Explores the creation of interactive geospatial visualizations using the Folium library.

# Contents of Each Lab Folder
Each lab folder typically includes:
    Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): The primary workspace for code, analysis, and explanations.
    Data Files (.csv, etc.): Any datasets used or generated during the lab.
    Other relevant files: Such as Python scripts, reports, or supporting documentation.
