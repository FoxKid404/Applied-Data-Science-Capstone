# Applied Data Science Capstone Labs

This repository contains my completed laboratory assignments and projects for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course. The labs cover a range of essential topics in data science, from data collection and wrangling to exploratory analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboard development.

## Repository Structure

The labs are organized into individual folders, each corresponding to a specific topic or assignment. This structure is designed to make it easy to navigate and find specific lab materials.

Here's a breakdown of the folder structure:

* **`Exploratory Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib/`**: Focuses on in-depth data exploration and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
* **`Exploratory Analysis Using SQL/`**: Explores data analysis techniques using SQL queries, demonstrating data retrieval and manipulation.
* **`Hands on Lab Complete the Machine Learning Prediction lab/`**: Contains work related to building and evaluating machine learning models for prediction tasks.
* **`Hands-on Lab Build an Interactive Dashboard with Ploty Dash/`**: Showcases the development of interactive web dashboards using Plotly and Dash for data visualization.
* **`Hands-on Lab Complete the Data Collection API Lab/`**: Covers methods for collecting data using various APIs.
* **`Hands-on Lab Complete the Data Collection with Web Scraping lab/`**: Demonstrates techniques for extracting data from websites using web scraping.
* **`Hands-on Lab Data Wrangling/`**: Addresses the critical process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.
* **`Hands-on Lab Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium lab/`**: Explores the creation of interactive geospatial visualizations using the Folium library.

## Contents of Each Lab Folder

Each lab folder typically includes:

* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)**: The primary workspace for code, analysis, and explanations.
* **Data Files (.csv, etc.)**: Any datasets used or generated during the lab.
* **Other relevant files**: Such as Python scripts, reports, or supporting documentation.

## How to View/Run the Labs

To view and run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/FoxKid404/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone.git](https://github.com/FoxKid404/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
    ```
3.  **Install necessary libraries:** Each lab might have specific dependencies. It's recommended to create a virtual environment. You'll likely need to install libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `plotly`, `dash`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`, `folium`, and database connectors (e.g., `sqlite3`, `psycopg2-binary`).
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly dash requests beautifulsoup4 folium
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # OR
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open the `.ipynb` files from the respective lab folders in your browser.
